# Oregon-Trails - Abdulrahman Baflah

Oregon Trails is a game that I developed which is meant to be played in the terminal. It is insipired by the original popular Oregon Trails.
The game is about 5 individuals where they have to survive until they reach the end of the trail. On the trail, they buy food, hike, rest,
hunt, and even fight other riders.
